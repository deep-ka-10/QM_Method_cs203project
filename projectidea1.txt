a) title: 
minimization of Boolean expression.

b) objective:
as logic circuits/gates are the basic building block of any hardware appliances hence its benificial to
know the optimized form of logic circuit which reduces the logic gates.
hence our objective is to reduce cost,complexity of the circuit and enhance the simulation efficiency by simplifying the algebraic
expression of a Boolean function.

c)it would be implemented as software application using c language.

d)functionality:

Logic minimization or optimization means replacing one group of gates with another that 
will perform the same task faster or use less real estate on the silicon.

we will try to make an software application that can take Boolean equations with any number of variable and optimize it for 2-level gates solution.
This can be implemented using the concept of Quine-McCluskey Method in c language.
QM Method is a tabular method that uses logical procedure that can be automated.
we implement this by taking the boolean expression as input from the user as sum of minterms and process them in stages to find 
prime implicants,essential prime implicants and finally the minimum number of prime implicants required to cover all the minterm 
and gives optimised boolean expression as an output.
